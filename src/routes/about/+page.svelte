    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
      The brand "Furry Fresh" is inspired by an adorable female Border Terrier named (you guessed it!) Furry. 
      It was this joyful ball of fur, a true star in the making, that sparked our journey to create high-quality pet food. 
      About a decade ago, Furry's owner, Henrietta, discovered how challenging it was to find pet food with natural 
      and premium ingredients. One day, Furry fell ill, suffering from skin lesions and painful itching. Determined 
      to restore her health through better nutrition, Henrietta began cooking for her. After all, why shouldn't every 
      family member, whether human or not, enjoy the same quality food? Brimming with inspiration, Henrietta teamed up 
      with experts, veterinarians, and animal nutritionists to develop nourishing, delicious, and high-quality food for 
      all our four-legged friends. At Furry Fresh, "quality" means food made from freshly prepared premium meat (without 
      animal or meat meal) and naturally nourishing, delicious ingredients. With a successful recipe and many happy dogs, 
      Furry Fresh was born.
